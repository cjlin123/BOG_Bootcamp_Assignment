                <p>Hello! I'm a first-year Computer Science major here at Tech and one of my passions is helping anyone around me. 
                    In the past, I operated as a freelance tutor at my high school, aiding my peers in areas from college applications to
                    SAT prep. Presently, in my role as a Student Worker at the Registrar's Office, I help friends with any
                    questions they have regarding registration or any other queries in this topic.</p>
                <p>A random fact about me is that my favorite animals are cats!</p>
